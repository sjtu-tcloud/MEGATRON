Updates for the 1.0 release for Intel Programmable Acceleration Card with Arria
10 GX FPGA, given an untarred copy of the release tarball. The blue/green boundary
remains unchanged and builds are compatible with the standard FIM.

The update here adds support for the Platform Interface Manager, improved user
clock constraints, and automatic setting of user clock frequency.
